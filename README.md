# gott

**gott** is a little text editor that I'm writing as a hobby project. It was inspired by 
[antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108) 
and Jeremy Ruten's 
[Build Your Own Text Editor](http://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/) 
tutorial. 
**gott** means "good" in Swedish, which is a presumptuous thing to 
call a tiny console text editor. Naming things is hard.

## Implementation

**gott** is written in Go and uses [nsf/termbox-go](https://github.com/nsf/termbox-go).

## Goals

I hope to integrate many of the Go-specific features that are often added as 
[emacs extensions](http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2014/05/22/configure-emacs-as-a-go-editor-from-scratch/).

## Legal

**gott** is released under the Apache License, version 2.0.
